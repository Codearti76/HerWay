# HerWay
AI-powered platform for women empowerment.
 It’s a mobile app made for women who want some real help managing their daily life, health, and personal growth. The app gives you personalized advice and resources, which is pretty cool because it feels like it’s tailored just for you.
Even though the government runs many schemes, women — especially in rural areas — often cannot access digital information due to low internet usage and limited awareness. For example, only around 15 % of women have reliable internet access, and a significant share lack mobile phones or digital skills, contributing to underutilization of benefits. This is why HerWay’s AI-driven, simplified, and bilingual approach is valuable.
  ⚠ Key Challenges
